#        USAGE:  ./Ch2.1.circ.pl  
#
#  DESCRIPTION:  Write a program that computes the circumference of a 
#  circle with a radius of 12.5. Circumference is 2Ï€ times the radius 
#  (approximately 2 times 3.141592654). The answer you get should be 
#  about 78.5. 
#  Modify the program from the previous exercise to prompt for and 
#  accept a radius from the person running the program. So, if the 
#  user enters 12.5 for the radius, she should get the same number 
#  as in the previous exercise.
